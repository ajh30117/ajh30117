HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Anna. I create documentation solutions for software projects. My most recent work has involved writing Online Help for enterprise cybersecurity SaaS, and creating the docs website for an open source startup project. 

I'm currently interested in docs-as-code workflows, documentation tools, web accessibility, and learning Python.
